# Write a program that asks the user to enter a personâ€™s age. The program should display a message
# indicating whether the person is an infant, a child, a teenager, or an adult. Following are the 
# guidelines:
#
#    If the person is 1 year old or less, he or she is an infant.
#    If the person is older than 1 year, but younger than 13 years, he or she is a child.
#    If the person is at least 13 years old, but less than 20 years old, he or she is a teenager.
#    If the person is at least 20 years old, he or she is an adult.
#

user = int(input("Enter a person age: "))

if user <= 1:
    print("You are an infant.")
elif user < 13:
    print("You are a child.")
elif user < 20:
    print("You are a teenager.")
else:
    print("You are an adult.")
