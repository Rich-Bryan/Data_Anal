# AverageNumberOfWords.py
#
# Your instructor has provided you access to a file named text.txt. The text that is 
# in the file is stored as one sentence per line. Write a program that reads the fileâ€™s 
# contents and calculates the average number of words per sentence.
#
#
# The main program has been created for you.  The main program will get some input from the user, invoke one or
# more functions to do the actual work and display some output.  Your job will be to create/update the function 
# that does the actual work and returns the results to the main program.
#
#
# Create a function called calculateAverageNumberOfWordsPerSentence.  This function will not be passed anything. 
# The function function will read the text file, calculate and return the average number of words per sentence:
